                    When a data scientist interviews a line-of-business expert about a business problem, the data scientist listens fo key words or phrases. The data scientist breaks the problem into a process flow that always includes an understanding of the business problem, an understanding the data that is required, anf the types of artificial intelligence (AI) and Data Analytics techniques that can solve the problem.
                    Together, this information drives an iterative set of thought experiments, modeling techniques, and evaluation against the business goals.
                    The focus must stay on the business.</p>
